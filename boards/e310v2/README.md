Based on the  original version, we have optimized the RF performance, added a GPS  module, increased an external 10M/PPS input interface, and used a VCXO.  The combination of VCXO and external reference input with DAC can  generate a more accurate and stable clock. In addition, the Ethernet on  the PL makes it possible for E310V2 to be compatible with UHD for higher bandwidth transmission.
