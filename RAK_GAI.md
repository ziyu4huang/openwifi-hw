The `xpm_fifo_sync` module is a parameterized macro provided by AMD (formerly Xilinx) for instantiating synchronous FIFOs in FPGA designs. It is part of the Vivado UltraScale libraries and is commonly used to manage data flow between different clock domains or to buffer data streams. https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug974-vivado-ultrascale-libraries/XPM_FIFO_SYNC?utm_source=chatgpt.com


In the context of the OpenWiFi project—an open-source IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi baseband implementation on FPGA—the `xpm_fifo_sync` module is utilized within custom IP cores to handle data buffering and synchronization tasks. However, when integrating this module into custom IP, some developers have encountered issues where the module is not recognized, leading to errors such as "Could not resolve non-primitive black box cell." https://adaptivesupport.amd.com/s/question/0D52E00006hpfjYSAQ/xpmfifosync-in-custom-ip-could-not-resolve-nonprimitive-black-box-cell?language=en_US&utm_source=chatgpt.com

To address this issue, consider the following steps:

1. **Ensure Proper Instantiation**: Use the language templates provided by Vivado to instantiate the `xpm_fifo_sync` module correctly. This ensures that all necessary parameters and ports are defined appropriately.

2. **Verify Library Inclusion**: Confirm that the Vivado UltraScale library, which contains the `xpm_fifo_sync` module, is properly included in your project. This may involve specifying the correct library paths or ensuring that the library is part of your project's dependencies.

3. **Check Synthesis and Simulation Settings**: Ensure that your synthesis and simulation tools are configured to recognize and include the `xpm_fifo_sync` module. This might involve adjusting tool settings or updating to a compatible version of the tools.

For detailed guidance on instantiating and configuring the `xpm_fifo_sync` module, refer to the official AMD documentation. https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug974-vivado-ultrascale-libraries/XPM_FIFO_SYNC?utm_source=chatgpt.com

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the `xpm_fifo_sync` module into your OpenWiFi project, facilitating efficient data handling and synchronization within your FPGA design.
